# RangerRhino23's APIs

Made by **RangerRhino23**!

These are just a few APIs that you can put in your project folder using this organization: ```assets\APIs``` which add some simple features into your project.
There is more information in each of the apis that will help you implement them into your project.
Some APIS require you to have a API key from a website. To use that API, you will need to provide your own API Key.
